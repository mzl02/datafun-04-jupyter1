    "Bitcoin volatility is a measure of how much the price of Bitcoin fluctuates over a period of time. A common way to calculate volatility is by using the **standard deviation** or **annualized volatility** of Bitcoin's daily returns. Here's how you can calculate it:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula for Volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate daily returns**:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   R_t = \\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   where:\n",
    "   - \\( R_t \\) is the return at time \\( t \\),\n",
    "   - \\( P_t \\) is the closing price of Bitcoin at time \\( t \\),\n",
    "   - \\( P_{t-1} \\) is the closing price at time \\( t-1 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate the average return** \\( \\mu \\):\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\mu = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{t=1}^{N} R_t\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   where \\( N \\) is the total number of days.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate the variance** \\( \\sigma^2 \\):\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{t=1}^{N} (R_t - \\mu)^2\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the standard deviation (volatility)** \\( \\sigma \\):\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Annualize the volatility** (optional):\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\sigma_{\\text{annual}} = \\sigma \\times \\sqrt{252}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   Here, 252 represents the average number of trading days in a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps for Calculation\n",
    "1. Get the historical Bitcoin closing prices.\n",
    "2. Compute the daily returns using the formula above.\n",
    "3. Find the average and variance of the returns.\n",
    "4. The square root of the variance gives you the volatility.\n",
    "5. Multiply by \\( \\sqrt{252} \\) if you want the annualized volatility.\n",
